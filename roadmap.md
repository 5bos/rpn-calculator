# Roadmap

## v1.0.0 features

- **Use a PostgreSQL dabatase :** for more scalability and large data support
- **Use an application server :** For the next step, I would add support for a Python application server such as `uvicorn`
- **Dockerize the project :** The project should dockerizing to avoid managing dependacies and manually running the server
- **Add a proper UI :** Implement a simple frontend that connects to the API and allows a better user interface and simpler interaction with the application
